# plugin-SigGen
Signal Generator plugin for LMS

This plugin is written by Triode and is imported from his old repository on [Google Code](https://code.google.com/archive/p/triodeplugins/). After Google Code shut down its service Triode's plugins got a temporary home on http://triodeplugins.herger.net/ which has now been migrated to [LMS-Community](https://github.com/LMS-Community).
